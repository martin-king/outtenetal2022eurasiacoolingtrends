# Supporting scripts and data for the review paper Outten et al. 2022.

This repository contains scripts and data that were used for exploring various ideas that led to some results in Fig. 5. The Matlab script that runs the AR1 model is `eurasiacoolingtrends_AR1.m`. The script `eurasiacoolingtrends_arima1.m` had been used to run the same model at some earlier stages of the research. It uses the arima function from the Econometrics toolbox. Identical results replicated by the two different scripts provided a 'self-verification' of the coding.
